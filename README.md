The One-Click Dense Pose project is designed to simplify the process of converting a regular input video into a DensePose-enhanced video with just a single command. DensePose is a method for mapping pixels in images of people to 3D surface coordinates and body part labels. This project streamlines the conversion process, making it accessible with minimal effort.

## Installation

To get started, follow these simple steps for setting up the One-Click Dense Pose project:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pawandeep-prog/one-click-dense-pose.git
   cd one-click-dense-pose
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the pre-trained DensePose models:

   ```bash
   sh download-models.sh
   ```

4. Run the conversion script:

   ```bash
   python convert.py --input PATH_TO_INPUT_VIDEO --output OUTPUT_VIDEO_PATH
   ```

5. Run the conversion script:

   it creates several files per input file UV map and the original segmentation
   
   ```bash
   python detect.py --i INPUT_FOLDER --output OUTPUT_FOLDER
   ```

Replace `PATH_TO_INPUT_VIDEO` with the path to your input video file and `OUTPUT_VIDEO_PATH` with the desired path for the output DensePose video.
